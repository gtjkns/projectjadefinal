Jade is a public platform with interactivity for patients, doctors, hospitals and pharmacy. We compare crowd sourced symptom frequency by Google Map with NASA World View Map. In this way environmental effect on human is identified by the help of environmental scientists.

Main features are:

1.Mother nature saves us from harmful impact of environment but as we progress. We harm our world causing threat to our next generations. We illustrate the environmental impact by NASA GIBS mapping and compare it by symptom frequency mapping to aware people about environmental condition and taking advise from environment scientists on a simplified scale.
2.Going from hospital to hospital, no seats, no doctors. We help people to find the best hospital where distressed can save their loved ones and give them the best treatment in no time.
3.An approach to help people connect to doctors home and abroad and patients alike. We collect information for helping doctors in developing country as they urge for historical medical information.
